    <p>
      This year I will present to you a different type of gift. 
      <br>
      I decided that what you really need this year is a few focused lessons in chess from someone qualified. 
      And so after some thought I have booked in 2 lessons with <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/profile/12900460">Josefine Heinemann</a>. 
      She seemed nice and seems to have a good methodology for teaching.
      <br>
      Sorry if you expected something tangible, but we live in a world of too many things and not enough experiences!
