    <p>
      This year I will present to you a different type of gift. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided that what you really need this year is a few focused lessons in chess from someone qualified. 
      And so after some thought I have booked in 2 lessons with <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/profile/12900460">Josefine Heinemann</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To redeem them, give me a shout and I'll give you her contact details for you to arrange when you feel like you want to have the lessons. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorry if you expected something tangible, but we live in a world of too many things and not enough experiences!
